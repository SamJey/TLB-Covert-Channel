How to execute :
On two separate terminals run the following commands:

Terminal1 - 
make
taskset -c <thread_no1> ./p1

Terminal2 - 
taskset -c <thread_no2> ./p2 <input in binary>

The two thread numbers should be distinct but correspond to the same core.
The two taskset commands should be executed simultaneously (as close as possible) in the two terminals
If either of the processes display an error message, restart and follow the above instructions again.
